"""Pending Verification Module.

This module maintains a list of albums that need re-verification in the future.
When an album's year cannot be definitely determined from external sources,
it is added to this list with a timestamp. On future runs, albums whose
verification period has elapsed will be checked again.

File operations (_load_pending_albums, _save_pending_albums) are asynchronous
using asyncio's run_in_executor to avoid blocking the event loop.

Refactored: Initial asynchronous loading handled in a separate async initialize method,
called by DependencyContainer after service instantiation.

Usage:
    service = PendingVerificationService(config, console_logger, error_logger)
    await service.initialize() # IMPORTANT: Call this after creating the instance

    # Mark album for future verification (now an async method)
    await service.mark_for_verification("Pink Floyd", "The Dark Side of the Moon")

    # Check if album needs verification now (now an async method)
    if await service.is_verification_needed("Pink Floyd", "The Dark Side of the Moon"):
        # Perform verification
        pass

    # Get all pending albums (now an async method)
    pending_list = await service.get_all_pending_albums()

    # Get verified album keys (now an async method)
    verified_keys = await service.get_verified_album_keys()
